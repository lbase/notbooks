Please check the cache and repair, replace or move as needed. Then: 

* Enable the listing
* Post an Owner Maintenance log to remove the Needs Maintenance attribute icon if present
* If necessary, use an ""Update coordinates"" log to edit the cache coords. 

Archive the listing if you no longer wish to own it.

Geocaching > Geocaching Challenges

In our effort to inspire outdoor play through Geocaching, we are often faced with decisions about what to focus on next, and what to focus on less. It is through these decisions that we explore opportunities to grow the global game of geocaching.

Occasionally, during this process, we are faced with the reality that certain ideas don't catch on as we had hoped. In these situations we owe it to ourselves and to you to make tough decisions about the future of every project and the resources to be applied to each. Sometimes, as a result, cool features must become casualties.

In this spirit, we have decided to retire Geocaching Challenges.

On an office wall here at HQ is a sign that reads, ""Let's make better mistakes tomorrow."" By accepting that we will sometimes get it wrong, we can allow ourselves to learn from and imagine new opportunities in the world of Geocaching. Our hope is we can take the lessons from Challenges and create better tools to guide you on your next adventure.

(visit link)

I've stopped publishing further caches along a couple of state roads in south Florida.
Find some other quieter more rural road , and you could be okay.

Geocaching is tolerated by FL state DOT now, mostly I suspect because they don't know that they could end it by simply contacting Groundspeak and asking for no more roadside caches. South Carolina and Virginia have already done this

I see each roadside new power trail as another opportunity for geocaching to be noticed by FL DOT and possibly banned.

The only official communication I've see with FL DOT is that they WILL NOT grant permission, as they think that granting permission creates liability. Geocaching is unauthorized non-transportation use of the right-of-way. They tolerate it, like a lot of public non-transportation use of the road right of ways, as a nuisance, what the public is doing. They remove caches that are troublesome.

Makes me nervous... but the other perspective is that the more there is of it, the
more that DOT sees it as a normal roadway use, or that perhaps there would be public backlash about banning it. LIke the huge mess over trying to ban roadside crosses. "

Once you try to honour a group, and especially if the wording suggests that the cache seeker might like to do the same thing, it's fairly easy to cross the line.  You might not think that anything as simple as honoring service personnel could be seen as an agenda, but that's generally how Groundspeak, the lackeys, and the reviewers will see it.

The line between an acceptable and an unacceptable agenda has to be drawn somewhere (example: ""this cache honours the gallant SS officers who fought to keep the Bolsheviks from invading our beloved German fatherland in 1945""), and Groundspeak has made the choice to draw that line right at the top of the page. 

This means that a number of causes which almost nobody on the planet would object to are excluded, as are causes which might be controversial internationally but which 99.9% of the people likely to visit the cache would support.

 Keeping agendas off cache pages is the best guarantee of keeping this game free for everyone, in the same way that keeping established religion out of the US Constitution is the best way to guarantee freedom of religion.

Hello [username]


Thanks for adding to the fun with a new cache. 

your cache is in a residential neighborhood, quite visible to residents. 
Did you speak with the homeowners nearby? do they know that there will be strangers driving into the neighborhood, parking oddly  and spending time practically in their front yard? Caches adjacent to private residences can be problematic.   It makes the homeowner unhappy to have this unexpected activity so near.

Making people uncomfortable in their own homes is not an acceptable consequence of playing the game of geocaching.  

This can have unhappy consequences for seekers if  police are called on geocachers. A common response of unknowing homeowners is to assume some kind of drug drop (yes, this is utterly inane, because of course drug dealers leave unattended product in random drop spots for others to pick up and NOT pay for ;-)

Telling them that a scavenger hunt item has been placed there will usually take care of this. Though sometimes their response will be to remove the cache. There's not much you can do about this, but at least you'll have tried. 

I have this cache on HOLD and on watch. Please respond with a new reviewer note. 
A reviewer note is a type of log to the cache page. 

Nothing will happen here until you post a new reviewer note.  If you need a few days to find the time to go speak with them, just tell me that. I'll want to see another note when they've been informed. 

**Alternately, and frankly better, find a new place for this.** 

[Select an appropriate location and container](http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#commonsense)

Select an appropriate location and container. Think about how your container and the actions of geocachers seeking it will be perceived by the public. Although your cache will be hidden with landowner or land manager permission, concerned passersby who are unaware of geocaching, may view people searching the property as suspicious...use common sense when selecting hiding places and containers."
154,6,8,"scout caches","""I'm trying to get a troop of Girl Scouts to each make a cache and hide it on our field trips"".

My experience is that scouts will not be able to maintain caches set on field trips. Please don't ask them to hide caches that they cannot be responsible for. Even if you are willing to maintain them, it seems to me that part of what they could enjoy and benefit from in cache ownership, is accepting the responsibility for the cache.

Until recently, I'd not seen a scout placed cache that was maintained by its owner. *
I've disabled them when they went missing, after being contacted by frustrated cachers. I've archived them when after many months they weren't repaired or replaced. I bookmark scout owned caches, knowing that the listing maintenance is probably going to be done by me (and the physical cache maintenance isn't going to be done at all).

*Recently, in south Florida, a BSA troop hid caches within walking range of the scouts. The boys can and are being responsible for the ownership of these hides.

Your cache page reads as a solicitation; it promotes {whatever}. {If relevant>>>} In general, a cache owner crosses the agenda line when they tell visitors what to do, feel, or think when they are at the location.
http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#solicitation

From the guidelines, ""caches perceived to be posted for religious, political, charitable or social agendas are not permitted. Geocaching is supposed to be a light, fun activity, not a platform for an agenda"", 

Groundspeak provides a cache listing service with the expectation that cache pages will be about the cache, with perhaps some information about the history or features of the location. Geocaching.com does not allow caches to be used as a tribute, or to honor any group or organization (the military, the Susan G. Komen Foundation, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, etc.).

If you choose to re-write your page to meet the guidelines listed above, I can review your page for publication. {Possibly some specifics here: please remove the following, ""support, give generously, etc"" } I'm going to disable the cache pending edits. (disable with a how to edit, how to enable note)

If you want to pursue publication of the cache as currently written, enable the cache without edits, and tell me that in a new reviewer note.
The cache will need to be reviewed by Geocaching.com staff for an exception to the listing guidelines by using appeals. I can help you with that process. {Ie, archive the cache, provide the appeals@geocaching.com email addy - wiki article appeals }

[URL of geocache map of area]

This many caches strung along roads starts to really strain the notion that ""no permission"" = ""adequate permission"". They tend to get noticed by local law enforcement, and not in a good way. 

Currently there are 3 states where the state DOT has contacted Groundspeak and requested that NO caches be placed on any part of any road right-of-way. Florida could easily be next on that list. Not only does those mean no guardrails, it means no signs, no caches at historical markers, no caches at rest stops, no caches at bridge overlooks, or fishing holes on the side of the road....it makes a big hole in where caches get placed. 

[I'll confess here that if you hadn't named it GRIM I might have missed it that it attaches the existing run and published it. I mention this because I suspect it happens, ie, ]I [may be] publishing caches that build on existing long runs. I don't generally open the Geocaching.com google map to see that. 

Please don't take this personally, I'm not picking on you. I've been making this distinction about roadside powertrails for a while, and probably should have started sooner - ie, capped GRIM and other long roadside series a lot sooner and a lot shorter.  

People email me about the bad stuff that happens when they cache - in the case of the South FL GRIM caches, it's apparent that local law enforcement knows about them, and is less then pleased.

I'm not going to pretend that I believe that anyone is getting permission for these. I can't believe any more that ""no permission"" is adequate. I think the whole thing has the potential to be a disaster for geocaching in Florida. 

RE actually getting permission - I honestly don't know what is possible. I wouldn't try it myself. I've seen 2 different DOT responses:
1) don't ask, don't tell - ie, if you ask they say no, because they think that giving permission creates liability for them - but theyknow about geocaching, and mostly ignore geocaches as long as the caches don't create an issue 

2) absolutely not, it's illegal, with reference to state law about modifying road structures, and littering laws

What I haven't seen is real permission from anyone who actually had the authority to grant it. 


http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx

All local laws apply.....
    Obtain the landowner's and/or land manager's permission before you hide any geocache, whether placed on private or public property. By submitting a geocache listing, you assure us that you have adequate permission to hide your cache in the selected location."

Your cache, GC Code, has a terrain/difficulty rating of (X).

It will not show up on the free intro app for a Basic Member.

2.1. What Geocaches am I Able to Find on the free Geocaching Intro app?

[quote][b]If you are a Basic Member, you will see:[/b]

    All geocaches types up to level 1.5 Difficulty and level 1.5 Terrain (D 1.5/T 1.5) [/quote]

The app download page also explains this, thought not very clearly.
It says, ""Find all easy Traditional geocaches"" - without explaining that means D/T of 1 and 1.5 only.
